# Etrian Exodus "Easter Egg"

I don't want just anyone uploading a card for Etrian Exodus â€“ I only want the people who are actually part of the
community. So, I should probably make something a bit esoteric (something Konami Code-ish) and release the method only
to the discord.

## Full method

1. Open the search panel and search for the community "Etrian Exodus"
2. This will pull up the list of all cards with that community. However, before all the other cards will be another,
    dummy card. This card will only show up when you search for Etrian Exodus specifically
3. Click the card to flip it
4. Click the card number five times and then the card name three times
5. This will open up the upload form with the community name pre-filled to "Etrian Exodus"
6. If you have cookies enabled, doing the easter egg once will have "Etrian Exodus" appear in the list of communities
    without you needing to do the easter egg again.

## Shortcut

1. On desktop, refresh the page and then type "EtrianExodus00000" (case insensitive)
2. This, too, will add a cookie for making future uploads easier.
