# Breaking components into steps

I feel that the best approach is to build things from the ground-up. I know that I'm either going to miss steps or
underestimate how long they're going to take, but having some plan is better than nothing.

## 1. Mongo Database

### Learning Mongo

1. Figure out exactly what MongoDB even is
2. Get the DB installed
3. Search for tutorial videos
4. Read through the documentation

### Implementing the database

1. Figure out the best way of structuring the data
2. Create the database

## 2. Node Server

### Learning Node

1. Figure out what Node and Express are
2. Look into what WebPack and Gulp are
3. Get everything installed
4. Search for tutorials
5. Read through documentation

### Implementing the back-end

1. Figure out how to set-up the server for handling basic requests
2. Figure out how to get the server to interface with the database
3. Test the server and the database together
4. Restructure the database if need be
5. Repeat steps 2–4 until I'm satisfied
6. Write a script for correcting guild cards
7. Implement the script into the Node server
8. Test the script
9. Rewrite the script if need be
10. Repeat steps 7–9 until I'm satisfied

## 3. React Site – Viewing Area and basic controls

### Learning SASS

1. Refresh my memory on how SASS works
2. See if I need to use Bourbon
3. Look up tutorials
4. Look through documentation

### Learning React

1. Watch Wes Bos' course
2. Take a glance through the documentation to see if I need anything else

### Implementing the core

1. Implement the viewing area and basic controls for the front end, but design for mobile first
2. Scale the design up to include desktop views (including one for super-wide monitors)
3. Implement the logic for clicking cards
4. Consider a parallax scroll?
5. Implement a staggered load-in animation for the cards
6. Modify the site to read sample card data from the database instead of hard-coded HTML
7. Implement the basic controls for the site
8. Do a lot of testing across each component

## 4. React Site – Upload form

## 5. React Site – Search

## 6. React Site – Report/request form

## 7. Fine-Tuning
